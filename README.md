# A one-page website I created.
 I used ReactJS, Typescript, TailwindCSS and React Three Fiber with a model I created in Blender to create this project. Not too much else to say but I basically wanted to experiment with using ThreeJS rendering within a more typical website use case rather than going completely all out and creating a whole ThreeJS website as I wanted to make sure the website is at least somewhat user friendly when it comes to loading times.
